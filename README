Gtk2::Spell version 1.04
========================

Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the GtkSpell graphical user interface
library.  This module allows you to write perl applications that utilize the
GtkSpell library for mis-spelled word highlighting.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you encounter problems in the linking step of the build process, with an
error message similar to: '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpspell' the
gtkspell-2.0.pc file most likely needs to have the -lpspell changed to
-lpspell-compat or -laspell-pspell. Thus using the pspell compatibility
libraries of aspell.

To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl:$PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
